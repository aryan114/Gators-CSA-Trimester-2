# Gators-CSA-Trimester-2
By Pranav, Aryan, Praveen, Neil
# Welcome to our Project!

### Description

Our project is focused around an E-Commerce store. Users will have to login to the system and play games in order to earn money to spend in the E-Commerce store. These games include a Snake Game and a Sports Simulation. With the money that they earned from playing the games, users can buy and checkout things in the E-Commerce store. 

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| E-Commerce | In the E-Commerce store, users can buy different items and add them to a cart. They can then checkout those items to simulate an actual E-Commerce website, like Amazon. Big Ticket Features will be professional UI and the sending/recieving data from AWS Database to keep a running log of the users expenses. |
| Snake Game | This is going to be one of the games that the users can play to earn money to spend in the E-Commerce store. Scores and earned money will be posted in the Database. This game is going to be similar to Google's Snake Game. Users can either buy powerups or buy items in the E-Commerce store. Big Ticket Items are the use of a DynaboDB to store data about money and points, which the user can see later. |
| Sports Simulation | This will be the second game that users can play to earn money to spend in the E-Commerce store. Users will be able to "bet" on teams and will win money if their team wins or will lose money if their team loses. Big Ticket Features will once again be nice UI and the sending/recieving data from Database. |
| Login-System | Users will need to use the Login System to log into their profile in order to save money/scores from the games to their account. Big Ticket Items will be professional UI and the storing of credentials in AWS Database to retrieve them later; because of this, users will only have to make their account once. |

### Self-Scoring For Week of 12/14

Focus on creating individual games. Integration of projects will take place once all individual games are complete.

| Member | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Pranav | **Critical Thinking**- I achieved coding goals (with hashmaps) and experimented with DynamoDB, but I need to spend more time on this. **Communications and Presentations**- I achieved goals from scrum board and added comments to communicate ideas with peers. **Collaboration**- I worked with Aryan on some AWS settings, and discussed with my team on what I need to do. **Creativity**- I worked with JFrames to make them look unique but I could have done more. **Total score: 19/20.**  |

| Aryan |**Critical Thinking**- I made a main menu and JPanel for the sports simulation, will play around with database after break. Most time was spent brainstorming and thinking about the process. **Communcations and Presentations**- I contributed to the scrum board and communicated ideas with my team. **Collaboration**- I collaborated with Pranav on AWS technical difficulties and communicated project ideas to the team. **Creativity**- I tried to make the JFrames look nice, but I wasn't able to. **Total Score: 19/20.** |
| Aryan Links | [**Main Menu Working**](https://github.com/aryan114/Gators-CSA-Trimester-2/blob/master/src/MainMenu/MainMenu.java#L1);; [**Sports JPanel created**](https://github.com/aryan114/Gators-CSA-Trimester-2/blob/master/src/Sports/Sports.java#L2) **Scrum Master: 4/5.** Hit 4Cs but didn't do enough for last point. |
| Praveen | **Critical Thinking**- I spent the week reasearching AWS since I'm new to databases. In addition, I started work on the JPanel for E-Commerce. **Communications and Presentations**- I helped Neil with the AP exam testing, and reviewed fundamentals that will be tested. **Collaboration**- I collaborated with Neil and helped him get started on his snake game. **Creativity**- My Jframes look unique, but I would have liked to have done more. **Total score: 19/20** |

| Neil |**Critical Thinking**- I spent the week learning how to develop a snake game by following a tutorial which challenged my thinking. I tried to understand everything from the tutorial so that I could further my understanding of Java. I will personalize the game and add database connection next week **Communications and Presentations**- I helped Praveen with the AP Unit 3 FRQ and we worked together on the multiple choice and discussed the answers that we got and how we got them. **Collaboration**- I collaborated with Praveen and Pranav by setting up IAM and also through the AP Classroom FRQ. **Creativity**- My snake game works and it has colors, but I would like to personalize it a bit more. **Total score: 19/20**  |
