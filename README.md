# Gators-CSA-Trimester-2
By Pranav, Aryan, Praveen, Neil
# Welcome to our Project!

### Description

Our project is focused around an E-Commerce store. Users will have to login to the system and play games in order to earn money to spend in the E-Commerce store. These games include a Snake Game and a Sports Simulation. With the money that they earned from playing the games, users can buy and checkout things in the E-Commerce store. 

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| E-Commerce | In the E-Commerce store, users can buy different items and add them to a cart. They can then checkout those items to simulate an actual E-Commerce website, like Amazon. Big Ticket Features will be professional UI and the sending/recieving data from AWS Database to keep a running log of the users expenses. |
| Snake Game | This is going to be one of the games that the users can play to earn money to spend in the E-Commerce store. Scores and earned money will be posted in the Database. This game is going to be similar to Google's Snake Game. Users can either buy powerups or buy items in the E-Commerce store. Big Ticket Items are the use of a DynaboDB to store data about money and points, which the user can see later. |
| Sports Simulation | This will be the second game that users can play to earn money to spend in the E-Commerce store. Users will be able to "bet" on teams and will win money if their team wins or will lose money if their team loses. Big Ticket Features will once again be nice UI and the sending/recieving data from Database. |
| Login-System | Users will need to use the Login System to log into their profile in order to save money/scores from the games to their account. Big Ticket Items will be professional UI and the storing of credentials in AWS Database to retrieve them later; because of this, users will only have to make their account once. |

| Aryan |**Critical Thinking**- I made a main menu and a JPanel for the sports simulation, will play around with database after break. Most time was spent brainstorming and thinking about the process. **Communcations and Presentations**- I contributed to the scrum board and communicated ideas with my team. **Collaboration**- I collaborated with Pranav on AWS technical difficulties and communicated project ideas to the team. **Creativity**- I tried to make the JFrames look nice, but I wasn't able to. **Total Score: 19/20.** |

| Praveen | **Critical Thinking**- I spent the week reasearching more about AWS from Amazon as I am new to databases. In addition, I started work on the JPanel for the Main website. **Communications and Presentations**- I helped Neil out with the AP exam testing, and reviewed the fundimentals that will be tested. **Collaboration**- I collaborated with Neil and helped him get started on his snake game. **Creativity**- My Jframes look unique, but I would have liked to have done more. **Total score: 19/20** |

| Neil |**Critical Thinking**- I spent the week learning how to develop a snake game. I did this by following a tutorial which challenged my thinking and made me see the code in a new light. I adamant on understanding everything that was done in the tutorial so that I could further my understanding of Java not just copying it. I plan on personalizing the game and adding database connection next week **Communications and Presentations**- I helped Praveen with the AP Unit 3 FRQ as well as working together on the multiple choice and discussing the answers that we got and how we got them **Collaboration**- I collaborated with Praveen and Pranav by getting the IAM accounts set up and also through the AP Classroom assignments. **Creativity**- My snake game works and it has colors, but I would like to personalize it a bit after fully understanding what the tutorial went over **Total score: 19/20** | |
